```toml
name = "majestikmagikcom" # Or whatever you want to name your worker project
main = ".vercel/output/static/_worker.js/index.js"
compatibility_date = "2024-01-01" # Use a recent date, like today or the start of the year
compatibility_flags = ["nodejs_compat"]

[build]
command = "npm run build"
dir = ".vercel/output/static"
```

*   **Explanation:**
    *   `name`: A simple identifier for your project.
    *   `main`: This points to the compiled Worker file generated by `next-on-pages`. Cloudflare Pages typically finds this automatically, but explicitly defining it ensures clarity.
    *   `compatibility_date`: This locks in the Workers runtime behavior to a specific date, preventing unexpected changes. Using a recent date is a good practice.
    *   `compatibility_flags = ["nodejs_compat"]`: **This is the key!** It tells the Cloudflare Workers runtime to enable compatibility for common Node.js APIs like `Buffer` and `async_hooks`.
    *   `[build]`: These are typical build settings, ensuring Cloudflare Pages knows how to build your Next.js project.
