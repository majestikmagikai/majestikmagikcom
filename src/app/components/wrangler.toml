# This is a configuration file for Cloudflare's command-line tool, Wrangler.
# It's used to configure and deploy your Next.js application to Cloudflare Pages.

# --- Local Development Configuration ---
# The following settings are useful when running `wrangler pages dev` locally.

# [vars]
# # You can set environment variables for local development here.
# # For example, if you were not using a .dev.vars file:
NEXT_PUBLIC_GEMINI_API_KEY=AIzaSyCghNNBdN1q0455EyfE0eFRVvdd3cHX0RY

# --- Bindings ---
# Bindings allow your application to interact with Cloudflare resources like KV, D1, and R2.
# You must first create these resources in your Cloudflare dashboard to get their respective IDs.
# Uncomment and configure the sections below as needed.

# [kv_namespaces]
# # Example of binding a KV namespace.
# # { binding = "MY_KV_NAMESPACE", id = "xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx" }

# [d1_databases]
# # Example of binding a D1 database.
# # { binding = "DB", database_name = "my-production-database", database_id = "xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx" }

# --- Secrets ---
# Secrets (like NEXT_PUBLIC_GEMINI_API_KEY) should not be stored in this file.
# For local development, use a `.dev.vars` file.
# For production, add them securely through the Cloudflare dashboard or via the `wrangler secret put` command.
