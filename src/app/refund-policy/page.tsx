      <p className="text-sm text-slate-400 mb-4">Last Updated: May 17, 2025</p>

      <p>
        At MajestikMagik.dev, we strive to provide high-quality digital products and services. We understand that sometimes things don&apos;t work out as expected. This policy outlines the conditions under which refunds may be issued.
      </p>

      <div className="space-y-2">
        <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold text-slate-100 mt-8 mb-4">Digital Products (e.g., templates, e-books, software licenses)</h2>
        <p>Due to the intangible nature of digital products, which cannot be returned once delivered, our refund policy for these items is as follows:</p>
        <ul className="list-disc list-inside space-y-2 ml-4">
          <li><strong>No Refunds After Download:</strong> Once a digital product has been downloaded or accessed, we generally do not offer refunds.</li>
          <li><strong>Exceptions for Technical Issues:</strong> If you experience significant technical issues preventing you from accessing or using the product, and our support team cannot resolve the issue within a reasonable timeframe, you may be eligible for a refund. Please contact us within <strong>7 days</strong> of delivery to report such issues.</li>
          <li><strong>Misrepresentation:</strong> If the digital product is significantly different from its description or if it fails to perform as advertised, you may be eligible for a refund. Evidence of misrepresentation will be required. Please contact us within <strong>7 days</strong> of delivery to report such issues.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold text-slate-100 mt-8 mb-4">Services (e.g., custom development, consulting, subscription services)</h2>
        <p>Refunds for services are handled on a case-by-case basis, depending on the nature of the service and work completed:</p>
        <ul className="list-disc list-inside space-y-2 ml-4">
          <li><strong>Project-Based Services:</strong> For custom development or consulting services, refunds will be evaluated based on the work completed and the agreed-upon milestones. If a project is cancelled before completion, any refund will be prorated based on the services already rendered and expenses incurred.</li>
          <li>
            <strong>Subscription Services:</strong>
            <ul className="list-disc list-inside space-y-1 ml-4 mt-2">
              <li>Monthly Subscriptions: Monthly subscriptions are generally non-refundable once the service period has begun. You can cancel your subscription at any time to prevent future charges.</li>
              <li>Annual Subscriptions: For annual subscriptions, a refund may be issued for the unused portion of the subscription, minus any non-refundable setup fees or a pro-rated amount for the time already used. A cancellation fee may also apply.</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li><strong>Cancellation Before Service Commencement:</strong> If you cancel a service before any work has begun or before the subscription period starts, a full refund may be issued.</li>
        </ul>
